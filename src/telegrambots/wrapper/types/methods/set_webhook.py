In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns *True* on success.

    If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL, e.g. `https://www.example.com/<token>`. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us.
